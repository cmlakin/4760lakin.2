Project 2

github: https://github.com/cmlakin/4760lakin.2.git


**Resubmission: 
	The program isn't running 100% the way that it should, but I did make it better
	It now has an automatice stop time of 5 seconds. It will exit once 5 real seconds
	have been reached. And I have it writing to the logfile. So not perfect, but
	better than it was before. It is the same github link as before. 


*Makefile working

ran with ./runsim 4 < testing.data

I had a lot of confusion with this project. I spent several sessions with a tutor who
left me feeling more confused that anything, and he didn't understand a lot of what we
had to use and kept talking me in circle. Found another tutor with little time left, but 
had a thurough understanding of C.

I really struggled with the shared memory at first. And with how to connect to the
Bakery Algorithm. Once I figured out that the bakery algorithm (not used 100% like
code given in ppt) could be a function called in the critical functions it started to 
get better from there. 

Spelling errors was another thing that got me more than once. That is something I need to
be really mindful of and would save a lot of time of having to go back through the code
and fix it. 

Getting my makefile working was huge on this project and definitely saved time when running and testing. It is already 12:17 and I realized that I did not go back and change my
print statements to write to the logfile. I will have to remember to do that next time. 

After scratching my first start to the project, I created a new repository but was feeling
a little overwhelmed that I completely forgot to push to it as I was working on the second
version. I put up post-it notes to remind me to do that everyday next time.
